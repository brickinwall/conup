#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

The goal of this project is to extend the [http://http://tuscany.apache.org/ Apache Tuscany] with the support for dynamically updating components in a running system in a safe and low-disruptive way.  


= Background Information =

Please refer to the following papers for the problem and solutions of dynamic component update:
  * [http://conup.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/esec121-ma.pdf Version-Consistency]
  * [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4359466 Tranquility]
  * [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=60317 Quiescence]

= Overall Architecture =

[https://conup.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/imgs/ConupProjectIntroduction/1.jpg]
We have extended Tuscany from four points, you can figure out from the aboving figure.
  * Transaction Management
Here, Transaction Management includes: the creation of tx id, the lifecycle management of transaction
  * Local future/past arc management
  * Interceptor for ack/notify
  * Component Lifecycle Management

= Overall Conup-Serivce module design =
In order to make our conup-service module be reusable, we design it as the following figure. 
[https://conup.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/imgs/ConupProjectIntroduction/2.jpg]
Any application server implement our spi in its own implmentation, it can use our conup service to make dynamic update.

=== Tuscany extension ===
  * TransactionManager inculdes: TxLifeCycleManager and TxDepMonitor
    i. TxLifeCycleManager is in charge of the creation of transaction id.
    ii. TxDepMonitor is used to response to the notification of the inserted code, and take respect action.

  * CompLifeCycleManager is in charge of the lifecycle management of the component(here we extend tuscany component lifecycle to accomdate to the update)

=== Conup SPI ===
