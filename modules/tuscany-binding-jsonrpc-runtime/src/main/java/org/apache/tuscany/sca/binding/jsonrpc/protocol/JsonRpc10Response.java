 * It has three properties:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>result - The Object that was returned by the invoked method. This must be null in case there was an error invoking the method.
 * <li>error - An Error object if there was an error invoking the method. It must be null if there was no error.
 * <li>id - This must be the same id as the request it is responding to.
