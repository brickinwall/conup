     * be relied upon in 1.x by the XMLStreamReader2CallableReference transformer, and can
     * be changed in 2.x without breaking anything.  
     *
     * I'd preferto move the responsibility for handling xsi:nil to transformers such as
     * XMLStreamReader2CallableReference.  While for something like JAXB, xsi:nil would
     * typically map to 'null', for something XML-centric like DOM I think it's more useful
     * to transform to a DOM Element with xsi:nil="true".   For now I'll leave this issue
     * unaddressed in 2.x, where we'd have to adjust XMLStreamReader2CallableReference in 
     * order to make a change like this.
