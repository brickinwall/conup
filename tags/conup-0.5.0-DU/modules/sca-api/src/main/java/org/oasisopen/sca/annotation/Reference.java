/**
 * The @Reference annotation type is used to annotate a Java class field,
 * a setter method, or a constructor parameter that is used to inject a
 * service that resolves the reference. The interface of the service
 * injected is defined by the type of the Java class field or the type
 * of the input parameter of the setter method or constructor.
 *
 * The @Reference annotation MUST NOT be used on a class field that is
 * declared as final.
 *
 * References can also be injected via setter methods even when
 * the @Reference annotation is not present.  However, the @Reference
 * annotation must be used in order to inject a reference onto a non-public
 * field.  In the case where there is no @Reference annotation, the name
 * of the reference is the same as the name of the field or setter.
 *
 * Where there is both a setter method and a field for a reference, the
 * setter method is used.
