/**
 * ModuleActivator represents a module that plugs into the Tuscany system. Each 
 * module should provide an implementation of this interface and register the 
 * ModuleActivator implementation class by defining a file named 
 * 
 * "META-INF/services/org.apache.tuscany.core.ModuleActivator"
 * 
 * The content of the file is the class name of the ModuleActivator implementation. 
 * The implementation class can have different flavors of constructors. The following
 * order will be searched:
 * <ul>
 * <li>(ExtensionRegistry.class) 
 * <li>(ExtensionRegistry.class, Map.class)
 * <li>()
 * </ul>
 *  
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The same instance 
 * will be used to invoke all the methods during different phases of the module 
 * activation. Note that the start and stop methods defined by this interface
 * take a reference to the Tuscany SCA runtime ExtensionPointRegistry. This 
 * gives the ModuleActivator the opportunity to add extension points to the
 * registry as it is requested to start up and remove them when it is requested
 * to shut down.
 *
