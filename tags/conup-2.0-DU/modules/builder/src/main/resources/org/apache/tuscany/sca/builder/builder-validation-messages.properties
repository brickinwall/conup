MultiplePolicyLanguagesInEPR = The policy sets for endpoint reference {0} contain policies specified in more than one language {1}  
MultiplePolicyLanguagesInImpl = The policy sets for component {0} implementation contain policies specified in more than one language {1}
JaxWSClientAsyncMethodsNotAllowed = [JCA100006] JAX-WS client-side asynchronous polling and callback methods are not allowed in service interfaces
PolicySetNotFoundAtBuild = PolicySet {0} is not defined in SCA definitions

TransactedOneWayWithTwoWayOp = The component reference {0} can not require transactedOneWay because the operation {1} is a two way operation
ImmediateOneWayWithTwoWayOp = The component reference {0} can not require immediateOneWay because the operation {1} is a two way operation
