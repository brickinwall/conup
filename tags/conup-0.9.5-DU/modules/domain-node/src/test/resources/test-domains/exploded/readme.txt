A domain directory showing a contribution jar exploded into a contribution directory.
In this case the contribution jar is ignored and the contribution directory is used.
Thats the same approach used for things like Tomcat with exploded webapps and it 
enables more easily supporting dynamic updates to individual files in a contribution.
