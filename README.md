# ConUp
ConUp is a prototype framework that allows for safe, timely, and low-disruptive dynamic updates of components on top of the SCA (Service Component Architecture) component model. ConUp extends [Apache Tuscany](http://tuscany.apache.org/), a well-known lightweight implementation of the SCA specification, but it is designed to easily be ported onto other component frameworks, like JBoss or Tomcat. Moreover, ConUp supports Quiescence, Tranquility, or Version Consistency, as possible approaches for updating components at runtime, and BF, CV, or WF as strategies for achieving freeness. The idea was originally published as a paper titled ["Version-consistent Dynamic Reconfiguration of Component-based Distributed Systems"](docs/paper/ESEC-FSE11.pdf) in ESEC-FSE '11.
